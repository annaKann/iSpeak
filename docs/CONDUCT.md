# 305 Soft Policy 


### Team Decision Making 
Team decisions will be made through a democratic process. Every member will have the opportunity to share their ideas, provide constructive feedback, and contribute to discussions. Final decisions should reflect a collective agreement and a unified commitment to the chosen course of action.

### Attendance
All members are expected to attend every scheduled meeting, both in and out of class. Attendance means more than simply being present, it requires active participation, respectful engagement, and meaningful contribution to team discussions.

Phones and other distractions should not be used during meetings unless directly related to the meeting topic. If a member needs to use their phone for unrelated reasons, they should briefly step out to avoid distracting the team.


## Assignments 
Each team member is expected to contribute equitably to assigned work. While contributions should be balanced, tasks may be distributed according to individual strengths and areas of expertise to maximize efficiency and quality.

We also recognize that team members have academic and personal responsibilities outside of this project. If a scheduling conflict (such as an exam) arises, it must be communicated well in advance so that responsibilities can be redistributed fairly and deadlines can still be met.
